# How to use our dev portal

If you want to get started with getML right away, we recommend to follow the
[installation instructions][installation-index] and then go through the
[getting started guide][getting-started]. 

If you are looking for more detailed information, other sections of this
documentation are more suitable:

- [Examples][examples-index]
  
    The examples section contains real-world getML projects using public datasets for easy follow-along. It showcases getML’s capabilities in feature engineering and predictive modeling, with practical demonstrations available in the [getml-demo](https://github.com/getml/getml-demo) repository on GitHub. You’ll find templates for your projects and a guide on integrating getML with FastAPI to create prediction endpoints.


- [User guide][user-guide]

    The user guide explains all conceptional details behind getML in
    depth. It can serve as a reference guide for experienced users but it's also
    suitable for first day users who want to get a deeper understanding
    of how getML works. Each chapter in the
    user guide represents one step of a typical data science project.

- [API reference][python-api]

    The API reference covers everything related to the Python
    interface to the getML engine. Each module comes with a dedicated
    section that contains concrete code examples.
