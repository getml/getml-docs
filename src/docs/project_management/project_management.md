# Managing projects

When working with getML, all data is bundled into *projects.* getML's projects are managed through the `getml.project` module.

## The relationship between projects and engine processes

Each project is tied to a specific instance of the [getML engine](#the_getml_engine) running as a global process (independent from your python session). In this way, it is possible to share one getML instance with multiple users to work on different projects. When switching projects through `getml.project.switch()`, the python API spawns a new process and establishes a connection to this process, while the currently loaded project remains in memory and its process is delegated to the background (until you explicitly `suspend()` the project). You can also work on multiple projects simultaneously from different python sessions. This comes in particularly handy if you use [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) to open multiple notebooks and manage multiple python kernels simultaneously.

To load an existing project or create a new one, you can do so from the 'Projects' view in the monitor or use the API (`getml.engine.set_project()`).

If you want to shut down the engine process associated with the current project, you can call `getml.project.suspend()`. When you suspend the project, the memory of the engine is flushed and all unsaved changes to the data frames are lost (see [lifecycles and synchronization between engine and API](#the_getml_python_api_lifecycles) for details). All pipelines of the new project are automatically loaded into memory. You can retrieve all of your project's pipelines through `getml.project.pipelines`.

Projects can be deleted by clicking the trash can icon in the 'Projects' tab of the getML monitor or by calling `getml.engine.delete_project()` (to delete a project by name) or `getml.project.delete()` (to suspend and delete the project currently loaded).

## Managing data using projects

Every project has its own folder in `~/.getML/getml-VERSION/projects` (for Linux and macOS) in which all of its data and pipelines are stored. On Windows, the projects folder is in the same location as `getML.exe`. These folders can be easily shared between different instances of getML; even between different operating systems. However, individual pipelines or data frames cannot be simply copied to another project folder â€“ they are tied to the project. Projects can be bundled and exported/imported.

## Using the project module to manage your project

The `getml.project` module is the entry point to your projects. From here, you can: query project-specific data (`getml.project.pipelines`, `getml.project.data_frames`, `getml.project.hyperopts`), manage the state of the current project (`getml.project.delete()`, `getml.project.restart()`, `getml.project.switch()`, `getml.project.suspend()`), and import projects from or export projects as a `.getml` bundle to disk (`getml.project.load()`, `getml.project.save()`).
