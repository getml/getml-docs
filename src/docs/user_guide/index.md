-  [Quick start][quick-start-guide] | 5 minutes

    If you are entirely new to getML, and you want to quickly sample its flavour, this is 
    the right place. A minimally viable example is presented, highlighting the 
    unique strengths of getML. 

- [Walkthrough][walkthrough-guide] | 2 hours

    If getML has already piqued your interest, and you want to delve deeper into 
    its capabilities, this is the right place. Along a more complex example you 
    will familiarize yourself with the typical structure of a data science project 
    using getML. From provisioning the data set, via data model definition, pipeline 
    handling, model training and prediction to feature extraction you learn about the 
    basics of getML’s python API as well as some of the underlying theoretical 
    concepts. 

- [Concepts][concepts-guide] 

    Together with the API Reference, Concepts forms the core the getML Dev Portal.
    The getML ecosystem is covered in the context of a typical Data Science project. 
    Theoretical principles are explained, and how they inform the functionality of 
    the software. While doing so, Concepts readily references the API 
    Documentation, which details all the nuts and bolts of getML. Whether novice 
    or seasoned getML practitioner this section is the #1 source of truth. -->

<!-- ## Examples & API -->
<!-- 
- [Examples][examples-index]
  
    The examples section contains real-world getML projects using public datasets for easy follow-along. It showcases getML’s capabilities in feature engineering and predictive modeling, with practical demonstrations available in the [getml-demo](https://github.com/getml/getml-demo) repository on GitHub. You’ll find templates for your projects and a guide on integrating getML with FastAPI to create prediction endpoints.

- [API reference][python-api]

    The API reference covers everything related to the Python
    interface to the getML engine. Each module comes with a dedicated
    section that contains concrete code examples.

_____________________________________________________
If you want to get started with getML right away, we recommend to follow the
[installation instructions][installation-index] and then go through the
