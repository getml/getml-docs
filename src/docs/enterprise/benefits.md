# **Why choose getML enterprise?**
[](){#enterprise-benefits}

ML teams working enterprise data, be it relational or time series, face a significat challenge. Building ML applications on top of traditional open-source ML libraries and algorithms take months of work, and results in hard to maintain model code and feature store infrastructure. GetML changes that.


## **Unprecedented value at a fraction of the cost**

GetML Enterprise is your choice if your business applicaton demands high model accuracies and short development cycles. Using getML, Data Science Teams will experience:

- **No Coding Overhead:** GetML Relational Learning eliminates the need for writing and maintaining extensive feature logic code, allowing your data science teams to accelerate development timelines and focus on business impact.

- **Fast Time to Market:** Streamline the MLOps process with GetML Relational Learning reducing project timelines from months to days and cutting model training times from hours to minutes.

- **Efficient Project Management:** Minimize delays and simplify workflows by reducing the need for intensive collaboration between data scientists and domain experts, enhancing overall team efficiency.


## **An Edge for ML-Driven Enterprises**

GetML Enterprise offers a suite of cutting-edge ML algorithms that surpass both the GetML community edition and other propositionalization libraries. The unique capabilities of GetML Enterprise algorithms provide several key advantages:

- **More Accurate Models:** Achieve double-digit accuracy gains across various use cases.
- **Robust Against Feature Drift:** Ensure consistent performance despite data pattern changes.
- **Captures Smallest Nuances:** Built for the complexity of real-world data where alternative solutions fail.
