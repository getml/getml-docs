# User Guide

This User Guide offers a detailed exploration of the getML ecosystem, structured to 
mirror the typical workflow of a data science project. It includes a thorough 
introduction to the key concepts and continually references the comprehensive 
Python API documentation.


### [getML suite][getml-suite]

This section provides an introduction to the core components of the getML suite: 
the **engine**, **monitor**, and **Python API**. It explains how these elements work 
together to 
support your data science projects.

### [Managing Projects][project-management]

Learn how to manage your projects within the getML engine. This section covers the 
functionalities of the project module of the Python API and how it is used to 
orchestrate project activities.

### [Importing Data][importing-data]

Data can be imported from variety of sources. In this section the reader learns about 
the **Unified import interface** and how it encompasses the import from a total of nine 
different sources. 

### [Annotating data][annotating-data]

A crucial building block on the way to automated relational feature engineering is 
the annotation of data. This section explains the **different roles** that exist and 
when to use them.

### [Data Model][data-model]

Explore the essential concepts of data modeling, including the distinction between 
population and placeholder tables. This section also discusses how to leverage 
high-level abstractions like the **star schema**, **snowflake schema**, and **time 
series** to 
simplify the data modeling process.

### [Preprocessing][preprocessing]

Discover how getML's built-in preprocessing functionalities, such as **Mapping** and 
**Imputation**, can streamline the typically labor-intensive task of data preprocessing.

### [Feature Engineering][feature-engineering]

At the heart of getML lies Feature Engineering. This section delves into the 
objectives of feature engineering and introduces the feature learning 
algorithms of getML: **FastProp**, **Fastboost**, **MultiRel**, **Relboost**, and 
**RelMT**.

### [Predicting][predicting]

This section introduces the **four built-in predictors** of getML and explains how they 
integrate into the overall getML pipeline to facilitate efficient predictions.

### [Hyperparameter Optimization][hyperparameter-optimization]

Though default parameters generally yield robust results, this section outlines how to
enhance model performance through getMLâ€™s straightforward hyperparameter optimization 
routines.

### [Deployment][deployment]

For deploying results and pipelines no external libraries are needed. This section
explains how the deployment works with built-in getML functionalities.

This guide aims to equip you with all the necessary information to effectively use 
getML for your data science projects, ensuring a seamless and productive experience.
