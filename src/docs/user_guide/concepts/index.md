# Concepts

Designed to align with the typical workflow of a Data Science project, this concept section 
offers detailed insights into key concepts, supported by references to the comprehensive 
Python API documentation. Its goal is to equip you with all the necessary information to effectively 
use getML for your projects, ensuring a seamless and productive experience.

### [getML Suite][getml-suite]

This section introduces the core components of the getML Suite: the **Engine**, **Monitor**, 
and **Python API**. It explains how these elements integrate to support your data science 
projects effectively.

### [Managing Projects][project-management]

Learn to manage your projects within the getML Engine. This section covers the 
functionalities of the project module in the Python API and how to **orchestrate project 
activities** seamlessly.


### [Importing Data][importing-data]

Discover how to import data from a variety of sources using the **Unified Import Interface**. 
This section covers importing data from nine different sources, providing a comprehensive guide.

### [Annotating Data][annotating-data]

Understand the importance of data annotation in automated relational feature engineering. 
This section explains the different roles in data annotation and their appropriate usage.

### [Data Model][data-model]

Explore essential data modeling concepts, including the distinction between population and 
placeholder tables. Learn to leverage high-level abstractions like the **Star Schema**, 
**Snowflake Schema**, and **Time Series** to simplify your data modeling process.

### [Preprocessing][preprocessing]

Learn how getML's built-in preprocessing functionalities, such as **Mapping** and **Imputation**, 
can streamline the often labor-intensive task of data preprocessing.

### [Feature Engineering][feature-engineering]

Feature Engineering is at the heart of getML. This section delves into its objectives
and introduces the feature learning algorithms of getML: **FastProp**, **Fastboost**, 
**MultiRel**, **Relboost**, and **RelMT**.

### [Predicting][predicting]

Explore the six **built-in predictors** of getML and learn how they integrate into the 
overall getML pipeline to facilitate efficient predictions.

### [Hyperparameter Optimization][hyperparameter-optimization]

Although default parameters generally yield robust results, this section outlines how to 
enhance **model performance** through getMLâ€™s straightforward **hyperparameter optimization** 
routines.

### [Deployment][deployment]

Deploy results and pipelines without the need for external libraries. 
This section explains the **deployment process** using built-in getML functionalities.
