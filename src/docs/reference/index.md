# Python API

Welcome to the API documentation for Python. The Python API is a convenient,
easy to use interface to the [getML engine][engine]. General
information about the interoperation of the different parts of getML can be
found in the [user guide][user-guide-index].

If you have never used the Python API, it is probably easiest to start with the
[walkthrough][walkthrough-guide].
