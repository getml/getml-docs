# How to use getML Dev Portal

This Dev Portal provides all the information you need to get you up and running with 
getML.

**User Guide**
   The User Guide provides a comprehensive overview of getML's features and capabilities.
   Conveniently it is divided in three levels of detail:

1. Quick Start

   If you are entirely new to getML, and you want to quickly sample its flavour, this is 
   the right place. A minimally viable example is presented, highlighting the 
   unique strengths of getML. It should not take you more than 10 minutes to 
   implement the example by yourself.

2. Walkthrough

   If getML has already piqued your interest, and you want to delve deeper into 
   its capabilities, this is the right place. Along a more complex example you 
   will familiarize yourself with the typical structure of a data science project 
   using getML. From provisioning the data set, via data model definition, pipeline 
   handling, model training and prediction to feature extraction you learn about the 
   basics of getML’s python API as well as some of the underlying theoretical 
   concepts. This walkthrough can be accomplished in 2 hours or less.

3. Concepts

    Together with the API Reference, Concepts forms the core the getML Dev Portal.
    The getML ecosystem is covered in the context of a typical Data Science project. 
    Theoretical principles are explained, and how they inform the functionality of 
    the software. While doing so, Concepts readily references the API 
    Documentation, which details all the nuts and bolts of getML. Whether novice 
    or seasoned getML practitioner this section is the #1 source of truth.
_____________________________________________________
If you want to get started with getML right away, we recommend to follow the
[installation instructions][installation-index] and then go through the
[getting started guide][getting-started]. 

If you are looking for more detailed information, other sections of this
documentation are more suitable:

- [Examples][examples-index]
  
    The examples section contains real-world getML projects using public datasets for easy follow-along. It showcases getML’s capabilities in feature engineering and predictive modeling, with practical demonstrations available in the [getml-demo](https://github.com/getml/getml-demo) repository on GitHub. You’ll find templates for your projects and a guide on integrating getML with FastAPI to create prediction endpoints.


- [User guide][user-guide]

    The user guide explains all conceptional details behind getML in
    depth. It can serve as a reference guide for experienced users but it's also
    suitable for first day users who want to get a deeper understanding
    of how getML works. Each chapter in the
    user guide represents one step of a typical data science project.

- [API reference][python-api]

    The API reference covers everything related to the Python
    interface to the getML engine. Each module comes with a dedicated
    section that contains concrete code examples.
