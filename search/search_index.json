It is recommended that you combine FastProp with mappings.</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/feature_engineering/feature_engineering/#multirel","title":"Multirel","text":"<p>Simply speaking, <code>Multirel</code> is a more efficient variation of Multi-relational Decision Tree Learning (MRDTL). The core idea is to minimize redundancies in the original algorithm by incremental updates. We then combined our improved version of MRDTL with ensemble learning methods.</p> <p>MRDTL is a strain of academic literature that was particularly popular in the early 2000s. It is based on a greedy, tree-like approach:</p> <ul> <li>Define some sort of objective function that evaluates the quality of your feature as it relates to the target variable(s).</li> <li>Pick an aggregation and some column to be aggregated.</li> <li>Try out different conditions. Keep the one that generates the greatest improvement of your objective. Repeat until no improvement can be found or some sort of stopping criterion is reached.</li> </ul> <p>The reason this approach has never really taken off outside of academia is that an efficient implementation is far from trivial. Most papers on MRDTL implement the algorithm on top of an existing relational database system, like MySQL.</p> <p>The main problem with trying to implement something like this on top of an existing database is that it requires many redundant operations. Consider a feature like:</p> <p><pre><code>COUNT the number of `transactions` in the last X `days`\n</code></pre> As we iterate through different values for the threshold \\(X\\), we are forced to repeat the same operations on the same data over and over again. Tasks like this bring traditional database engines to their knees.</p> <p>The core idea of getML's Multirel algorithm is to minimize redundancies through <code>incremental updates</code>. To allow for incremental updates and maximal efficiency, we developed a database engine from scratch in C++. When we evaluate a feature like:</p> <pre><code>COUNT the number of `transactions` in the last 90 `days`\n</code></pre> <p>and</p> <pre><code>COUNT the number of `transactions` in the last 91 `days`\n</code></pre> <p>very little changes in between. Multirel only recalculates what has changed and keeps everything else untouched. Therefore, it needs two ingredients that can be incrementally updated: An objective function and the actual aggregation(s).</p> <p>Our first ingredient is an objective function that must be suited for incremental updates. When we move from 90 to 91 days, presumably only very few lines in the population table actually change. We do not need to recalculate the entire table. In practice, most commonly used objective functions are fine and this is not much of a limitation. However, there are some, like rank correlation, that cannot be used.</p> <p>The second ingredient, the aggregations, must allow for incremental updates too. This part is a bit harder, so let us elaborate: Let\u2019s say we have a match between the population table that contains our targets and another table (or a self-join). This match happens to be between the two thresholds 90 and 91 days. As we move from 90 to 91 days, we have to update our aggregation for that match. For maximum efficiency, this needs also to be done incrementally. That means we do not want to recalculate the entire aggregation for all matches that it aggregates - instead just for the one match in between the two thresholds.</p> <p>We want to also support the <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> combinations of conditions. Therefore, it is possible that a match was not included in the aggregation before, but becomes part of it as we move the threshold. It is also possible that the match was included in the aggregation, but now it isn\u2019t anymore.</p> <p>For an aggregation like <code>Count</code>, incremental updates are straight-forward. If the match was not included, but now it is, then increment by 1. If was included, but it isn\u2019t anymore, then decrement by 1.</p> <p>Things are more tricky for aggregations like <code>Max</code>, <code>Median</code>, or <code>CountDistinct</code>. For instance, whereas incrementing <code>Max</code> is easy, decrementing it is hard. If the match used to be included and is in fact the maximum value, we now have to find the next biggest match. And we have to find it quickly - ideally iterating through a set of thresholds should take linear time in the number of matches. To make it even more complicated, some cross-joins might result in a lot of matches, so any data structures that have non-trivial memory overhead are a no-go.</p> <p>Everything so far has shed light on how we train one feature. But in practice, we want more than one. So, how do we do that? Since we are using a tree-based algorithm anyway, we are able to harness the power of ensemble learning algorithms that have been shown to work very well with non-relational decision trees, namely bagging and gradient boosting.</p> <p>With bagging, we just sample randomly from our population table. We train a feature on that sample and then pick a different random sample to train the next feature.</p> <p>With gradient boosting, we calculate the pseudo-residuals of our previously trained features. We then train features that predict these pseudo-residuals. This procedure guarantees that new features are targeted and compensate the weaknesses of older ones.</p> <p>Transpiled to SQL, a typical feature generated by Multirel looks like this:</p> <p></p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE FEATURE_1 AS\nSELECT COUNT( * ) AS feature_1,\n       t1.join_key,\n       t1.time_stamp\nFROM (\n     SELECT * ,\n            ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( ORDER BY join_key, time_stamp ASC ) AS rownum\n     FROM POPULATION\n) t1\nLEFT JOIN PERIPHERAL t2\nON t1.join_key = t2.join_key\nWHERE (\n   ( t1.time_stamp - t2.time_stamp &lt;= 0.499624 )\n) AND t2.time_stamp &lt;= t1.time_stamp\nGROUP BY t1.rownum,\n         t1.join_key,\n         t1.time_stamp;\n</code></pre> <p>Further information can be found in the API documentation for <code>Multirel</code>.</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/feature_engineering/feature_engineering/#relboost","title":"Relboost","text":"<p><code>Relboost</code> is a generalization of the gradient boosting algorithm.

That means that the number of possible features is \\(\\mathcal{O}(n^2)\\) in the number of columns in the original tables.

Thus, it can require a vast amount of splits to approximate a linear relationship.</p> <p>Here is a typical RelMT feature:</p> <p><pre><code>CREATE TABLE FEATURE_1 AS\nSELECT SUM(\nCASE\n    WHEN ( t1.time_stamp - t2.time_stamp &gt; 0.499624 ) THEN\nCOALESCE( t1.time_stamp - julianday( '1970-01-01' ) - 17202.004, 0.0 ) * -122.121 + COALESCE( t2.column - 3301.156, 0.0 ) * -0.003 \n    WHEN ( t1.time_stamp - t2.time_stamp &lt;= 0.499624 OR t1.time_stamp IS NULL OR t2.time_stamp IS NULL ) THEN\nCOALESCE( t1.time_stamp - julianday( '1970-01-01' ) - 17202.004, 0.0 ) * 3.654 + COALESCE( t2.column - 3301.156, 0.0 ) * -1.824 + -8.720\n     ELSE NULL\nEND\n) AS feature_1,\n     t1.join_key,\n     t1.time_stamp\nFROM (\n     SELECT *,\n            ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( ORDER BY join_key, time_stamp ASC ) AS rownum\n     FROM POPULATION\n) t1\nLEFT JOIN PERIPHERAL t2\nON t1.join_key = t2.join_key\nWHERE t2.time_stamp &lt;= t1.time_stamp\nGROUP BY t1.rownum,\n         t1.join_key,\n         t1.time_stamp;\n</code></pre> RelMT features share some characteristics with Relboost features: Compare the example feature to the Relboost feature above. Both algorithms generate splits based on a combination of conditions (the <code>WHEN</code> part of the <code>CASE WHEN</code> statement above). But while Relboost learns weights for its leaves (the <code>THEN</code> part of the <code>CASE WHEN</code> statement), RelMT learns a linear model, allowing for linear combinations between columns from the population table and columns of a certain peripheral table.</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/getml_suite/engine/","title":"Engine","text":""},{"location":"user_guide/getml_suite/engine/#the-getml-engine","title":"The getML engine","text":"<p>The getML engine is a standalone program written in C++ that does the actual work of feature engineering and prediction.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"user_guide/getml_suite/engine/#starting-the-engine","title":"Starting the engine","text":"<p>The engine can be started using the dedicated launcher icon or by using the getML command line interface (CLI).
