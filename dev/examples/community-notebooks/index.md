# Community Edition Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the extensive features and 
capabilities of the getML Community Edition. These notebooks are designed to cover a 
wide range of data types, prediction tasks, difficulty levels, and application domains, 
providing an excellent foundation for your own projects.

!!! note
    Community Edition notebooks can be run locally or on Google Colab without restrictions, 
    while some features in the [Enterprise Edition notebooks](../enterprise-notebooks/index.md) require a license for full 
    functionality.
