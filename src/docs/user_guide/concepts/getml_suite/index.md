# The getML Suite

The getML ecosystem comprises three fundamental components:

- [Engine][engine]

    Written in C++, the getML engine is the core of the suite and does all the heavy lifting. It is responsible for data management, feature engineering, and machine learning.

- [Python API][getml-suite-python-api]

    Control the engine with the getML Python API, which provides handlers to the objects in the engine and all other necessary tools for end-to-end data science projects.

- [Monitor][monitor]

    Use the getML monitor, written in Go, for exploring datasets, visualizing ML models, and managing logins and accounts for the getML suite.

To get started, head over to the [installation instructions][installation].
